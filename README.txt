## Project Overview

The **Astronomical App using NASA API** is a modern web application that allows users to explore the **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)** provided by NASA. The app fetches daily space images or videos, along with descriptions and copyright information, allowing users to immerse themselves in the wonders of the universe.

This project is ideal for astronomy enthusiasts, students, educators, and anyone passionate about exploring space.

### Key Objectives

- Display NASA’s APOD dynamically.  
- Allow users to select a specific date to view images/videos.  
- Provide a **random APOD feature** to explore interesting astronomical content.  
- Include a **download button** for images.  
- Offer an **immersive UI** with background space video and a modern 3D card layout.

## How It Works

1. The app makes a request to the NASA APOD API using a secure API key.  
2. The API responds with JSON containing image/video URL, title, explanation, copyright, and HD URL.  
3. The app dynamically displays the content in a responsive card layout.  
4. Users can pick a specific date, click **Random**, or view **today's APOD**.  
5. If the APOD is a video, it embeds the video directly; if it’s an image, it displays it with a download option.
